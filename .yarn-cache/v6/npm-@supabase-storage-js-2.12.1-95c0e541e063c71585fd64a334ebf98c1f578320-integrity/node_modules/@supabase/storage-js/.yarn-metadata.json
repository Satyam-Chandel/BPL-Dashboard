For a complete list see the [Supabase API reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload).\n\n- Download a file from an exisiting bucket:\n\n  ```js\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').download('path/to/file')\n  ```\n\n- List all the files within a bucket:\n\n  ```js\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').list('folder')\n  ```\n\n  > Note: The `list` method also accepts a map of optional parameters. For a complete list see the [Supabase API reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-list).\n\n- Replace an existing file at the specified path with a new one:\n\n  ```js\n  const fileBody = ... // load your file here\n\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient\n    .from('bucket')\n    .update('path/to/file', fileBody)\n  ```\n\n  > Note: The `upload` method also accepts a map of optional parameters. For a complete list see the [Supabase API reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload).\n\n- Move an existing file:\n\n  ```js\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient\n    .from('bucket')\n    .move('old/path/to/file', 'new/path/to/file')\n  ```\n\n- Delete files within the same bucket:\n\n  ```js\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').remove(['path/to/file'])\n  ```\n\n- Create signed URL to download file without requiring permissions:\n\n  ```js\n  const expireIn = 60\n\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient\n    .from('bucket')\n    .createSignedUrl('path/to/file', expireIn)\n  ```\n\n- Retrieve URLs for assets in public buckets:\n\n  ```js\n  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('public-bucket').getPublicUrl('path/to/file')\n  ```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nSupplying `.throwOnError()` will throw errors instead of returning them as a property on the response object.\n\n  ```js\n  try {\n    const { data } = await storageClient\n      .from('bucket')\n      .throwOnError()\n      .download('path/to/file')\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error)\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Sponsors\n\nWe are building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products.
