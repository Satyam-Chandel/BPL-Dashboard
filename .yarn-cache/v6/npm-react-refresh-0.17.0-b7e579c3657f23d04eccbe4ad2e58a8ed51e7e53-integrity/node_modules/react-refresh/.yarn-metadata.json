Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old feature known as \"hot reloading\", but Fast Refresh is more reliable and officially supported by React.\n\nThis package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins. If youâ€™re working on one, here is a [rough guide](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) for Fast Refresh integration using this package.\n",
