This can be a [REST API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/prisma-in-your-stack/rest), a [GraphQL API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/prisma-in-your-stack/graphql) a gRPC API, or anything else that needs a database.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe fastest way to get started with Prisma is by following the [**Quickstart (5 min)**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart-typescript).\n\nThe Quickstart is based on a preconfigured SQLite database. You can also get started with your own database (PostgreSQL and MySQL) by following one of these guides:\n\n- [Add Prisma to an existing project](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project-typescript-postgres)\n- [Set up a new project with Prisma from scratch](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch-typescript-postgres)\n\n## Community\n\nPrisma has a large and supportive [community](https://www.prisma.io/community) of enthusiastic application developers. You can join us on [Slack](https://slack.prisma.io) and here on [GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions).\n\n## Security\n\nIf you have a security issue to report, please contact us at [security@prisma.io](mailto:security@prisma.io?subject=[GitHub]%20Prisma%202%20Security%20Report%20).\n\n## Support\n\n### Ask a question about Prisma\n\nYou can ask questions and initiate [discussions](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/) about Prisma-related topics in the `prisma` repository on GitHub.\n\nðŸ‘‰ [**Ask a question**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/new)\n\n### Create a bug report for Prisma\n\nIf you see an error message or run into an issue, please make sure to create a bug report! You can find [best practices for creating bug reports](https://www.prisma.io/docs/support/creating-bug-reports) (like including additional debugging output) in the docs.\n\nðŸ‘‰ [**Create bug report**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)\n\n### Submit a feature request\n\nIf Prisma currently doesn't have a certain feature, be sure to check out the [roadmap](https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/roadmap) to see if this is already planned for the future.\n\nIf the feature on the roadmap is linked to a GitHub issue, please make sure to leave a +1 on the issue and ideally a comment with your thoughts about the feature!\n\nðŸ‘‰ [**Submit feature request**](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)\n\n## Contributing\n\nRefer to our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct for contributors](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Build Status\n\n- Prisma Tests Status:  \n  [![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/590e1981074b70961362481ad8319a831b44a38c5d468d6408.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/prisma/prisma2-test)\n- Ecosystem Tests Status:  \n  [![Actions Status](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/actions)\n",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
